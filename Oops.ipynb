        "**Q1:** What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?  \n",
        "**A1:** OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes data and behavior into objects, enabling modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2:** What is a class in OOP?  \n",
        "**A2:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3:** What is an object in OOP?  \n",
        "**A3:** An object is an instance of a class, encapsulating data and functions to represent real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4:** What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?  \n",
        "**A4:** Abstraction hides implementation details to show only essential features, while encapsulation restricts access to internal data through access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5:** What are dunder methods in Python?  \n",
        "**A5:** Dunder methods (like `__init__` and `__str__`) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, used to define object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6:** Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.  \n",
        "**A6:** Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), enabling code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7:** What is polymorphism in OOP?  \n",
        "**A7:** Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling methods to perform differently based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8:** How is encapsulation achieved in Python?  \n",
        "**A8:** Encapsulation is achieved by defining class attributes as private (using `_` or `__`) and providing access through getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9:** What is a constructor in Python?  \n",
        "**A9:** A constructor is the `__init__` method in Python, automatically called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10:** What are class and static methods in Python?  \n",
        "**A10:** Class methods (`@classmethod`) operate on the class itself, while static methods (`@staticmethod`) donâ€™t depend on class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11:** What is method overloading in Python?  \n",
        "**A11:** Python does not support traditional method overloading but allows default arguments to simulate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12:** What is method overriding in OOP?  \n",
        "**A12:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method from its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13:** What is a property decorator in Python?  \n",
        "**A13:** The `@property` decorator in Python allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enhancing encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14:** Why is polymorphism important in OOP?  \n",
        "**A14:** Polymorphism promotes flexibility and code reuse, allowing objects of different types to be treated uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15:** What is an abstract class in Python?  \n",
        "**A15:** An abstract class is a class with at least one abstract method, which must be implemented in derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16:** What are the advantages of OOP?  \n",
        "**A16:** OOP offers modularity, code reuse, scalability, maintainability, and improved problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q17:** What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?  \n",
        "**A17:** A class variable is shared across all instances of a class, while an instance variable is specific to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q18:** What is multiple inheritance in Python?  \n",
        "**A18:** Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining attributes and methods from all.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q19:** Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.  \n",
        "**A19:** `__str__` provides a user-friendly string representation of an object, while `__repr__` provides a developer-friendly one.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20:** What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?  \n",
        "**A20:** The `super()` function allows a child class to access methods or constructors of its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q21:** What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?  \n",
        "**A21:** The `__del__` method is a destructor called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q22:** What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?  \n",
        "**A22:** `@staticmethod` does not access the class or instance, while `@classmethod` takes the class as its first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q23:** How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?  \n",
        "**A23:** Polymorphism allows methods in a parent class to be overridden in child classes, enabling behavior specific to the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q24:** What is method chaining in Python OOP?  \n",
        "**A24:** Method chaining involves calling multiple methods on an object in a single statement by returning `self` from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q25:** What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?  \n",
        "**A25:** The `__call__` method makes an object callable like a function, enabling custom behavior when the object is \"called.\""
